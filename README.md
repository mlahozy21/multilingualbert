# Structural Probes for Spanish Syntax: mBERT & AnCora

This repository contains an experimental replication of the paper **"A Structural Probe for Finding Syntax in Word Representations"** (Hewitt & Manning, 2019), adapted specifically for the **Spanish language**.

The primary objective is to investigate whether multilingual language models (such as **mBERT**) encode Spanish syntactic structure (dependency trees) within their vector geometry, without having been explicitly trained with syntactic supervision.

## 📊 Results

We trained a linear probe for the **Parse Distance** task using embeddings from the 12th layer of `bert-base-multilingual-cased`.

| Metric | Result (Spanish) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Spearman Correlation** | **0.735** | **High correlation.** Confirms that mBERT captures the geometric distance between syntactically related words in Spanish. |
| **UUAS** | **0.504** | **Reconstruction accuracy.** Significantly outperforms the random baseline (0.44), demonstrating latent structural learning. |
## 🛠️ Modifications & Engineering

To adapt the original 2019 codebase to a modern environment and the specific linguistic features of Spanish, the following key implementations were made:

### 1. Data Alignment (Critical Fix)
Spanish contains contractions (e.g., *del* = *de* + *el*, *al* = *a* + *el*) that are split in the Universal Dependencies (CoNLL-U) format using range indices (e.g., `1-2`). This caused a severe misalignment between the tokenized BERT embeddings and the gold-standard labels. 
* **Solution:** We implemented a filtering strategy in `conllu_to_text.py` and `data.py` to strictly ignore range indices, ensuring a 1-to-1 mapping between the embedding subwords and the syntactic labels.

### 2. Mathematical Optimization
The original distance calculation algorithm in `task.py` was iterative and prone to infinite loops when encountering cyclic dependencies in the annotation data.
* **Solution:** The algorithm was rewritten using a **vectorized Floyd-Warshall algorithm** with NumPy. This ensures robustness against cycles and reduced the pre-computation time from minutes to seconds.

### 3. Library Migration
* **Transformers:** Replaced the obsolete `pytorch-pretrained-bert` with the modern HuggingFace `transformers` library.
* **Windows/UTF-8:** Enforced `utf-8` encoding across all file I/O operations to correctly handle Spanish accents and special characters on Windows systems.


## 🚀 Reproduction Steps
### 1. Requirements
Install the necessary Python packages:
```
Bash

pip install torch transformers h5py tqdm matplotlib numpy pyyaml
```
### 2. Dataset Download
Download the Universal Dependencies Spanish AnCora corpus (v2.x) from the official repository: UD_Spanish-AnCora GitHub.

Place the .conllu files in the data/es_ancora/ folder:

es_ancora-ud-train.conllu

es_ancora-ud-dev.conllu

es_ancora-ud-test.conllu

### 3. Data Cleaning & Alignment
Run the custom cleaning script to extract raw text and remove contraction ranges (fixing the alignment issue):
```
Bash

python conllu_to_text.py data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-train.conllu data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-train.txt
python conllu_to_text.py data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-dev.conllu data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-dev.txt
python conllu_to_text.py data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-test.conllu data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-test.txt
```
### 4. Embedding Generation
Pre-compute the mBERT embeddings. This freezes the model layers into HDF5 files for faster training.
```
Bash

python generate_embeddings.py data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-train.txt data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-train.hdf5
python generate_embeddings.py data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-dev.txt data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-dev.hdf5
python generate_embeddings.py data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-test.txt data/es_ancora/es_ancora-ud-test.hdf5
```
### 5. Running the Experiment
Train the structural probe using the configuration file:
```
Bash

python structural-probes/run_experiment.py es_ancora.yaml
```
